<h3>NP_ModComments overview</h3>

<p>Allows you to add a comment moderation system (like the one on /. to your site).
This plugin offered the core functionality and Tim (the original author) hoped that, later on,
 he (or other people) could make
plugins that depend on this one (like: calculating a member's score, hiding troll comments, etc)</p>




<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Simply upload to the plugin folder in the usual way. 
    Then visit the admin area and select the plugin for installation.</p>

<p>There is a community hosted FAQ on installing plugins that can be found <a href="http://faq.nucleuscms.org/item/35">here</a>.</p>

<p>However it would probably not be fair to bug Tim over this newly revised version of his code.

Quick Reference
----------------
 
** SETUP **
  There are no options to set but you can configure this plugin very well by 
	editing this file.
 
	1) Setting the different moderation classes:
 
		Scroll down this file untill you find the function NP_ModComments. You will see a
		list of the currently enabled moderation classes.
 
		The structure is quite easy:
 
		$this->mod[0]['name'] = 'example name';
		$this->mod[0]['score'] = 5;
 
		As you see the moderation classes all have a number (in the example above it's 0).
		When you want to add another class you have to give it the next number. So, when
		the last moderation class in the list has number 7 the next one will have to have
		number 8 ($this->mod[8]['name'] = ...). I hope you get the idea.
 
		The score needs to be unique. No two moderation classes can have the same score.
 
	2) Showing a message to non-members:
 
		You can only vote when you are a member. By default people who are not a member of
		your weblog will simply not see the moderationbox. If you want them to see a message
		like 'Sorry, only members can moderate comments' you have to remove the // on line 156
